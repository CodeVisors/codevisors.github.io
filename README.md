This started out by mentoring and delivering workshops in association with tech for good charities, to creating and building the CodeVisors Community.

We opened this server specially for developers & coders so that they can get a good and nice space for working, showing their creations, find some more peoples of their kind and can collaborate with other developers and get a good environment for coding. You can discuss, talk, make projects and can do anything here with other developers. Peoples who are not developers can also join us because they can also get space for chilling and make some new nice friends and make the community enjoyful.</li>
